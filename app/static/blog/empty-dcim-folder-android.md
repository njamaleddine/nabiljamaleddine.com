<!-- # Missing files/Empty DCIM folder on Android -->
<!-- Published: 2016-12-18 -->

I was recently backing up my android phone to transfer files over to a new phone when I noticed that the **DCIM** folder was only showing the latest 100 or so photos when connected to my laptop, when I knew I must have had at least 1000 on the device. Oddly enough they also weren't showing up while using a file manager either.

Clearing the cache and data for **External Storage** and **Media Storage** allowed all of the files to show up again for me.


## Solution

1. Go to **Settings -> Apps**

2. On the top right tap on the **â‹®** (tree vertical dots) and select **Show system**

3. Select **External Storage**, tap on **Storage** and tap on **Clear cache** and **Clear data**

4. Go back, and find **Media Storage**, tap on **Storage** and tap on **Clear cache** and **Clear data**

5. Restart your phone
